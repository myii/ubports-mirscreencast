# ubports-mirscreencast

Main purpose here is to get `semantic-release` working.

* Not yet but have just set tags up to `v0.0.4` on the commits so far.
* ~Not triggered when pushing direct to `master`.~
    * Actually, it does.
    * Stuck at `The commit should not trigger a release`, probably because of the commit messages not matching the right format, something like `fix(pencil): stop graphite breaking when too much pressure applied`.
    * OK, got to `v0.0.5` automatically with the commit message done properly!
* Trying with all sorts of updated settings and token authentication.
* Trying `language: minimal`.
